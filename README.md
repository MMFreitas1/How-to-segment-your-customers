# How-to-segment-your-customers
A data-driven approach on how to create personas through their purchasing behavior

📖 Context:

Quote: "I work as a Data Scientist in a medical device manufacturer in Switzerland called Johansson & Johansson, a company that manufactures orthopedic devices and sells them worldwide, directly to individual doctors who use them on rehabilitation and physical therapy patients.

Historically, the sales and customer support departments have grouped doctors by geography. However, the region is not a good predictor of the number of purchases a doctor will make or their support needs.

My team wants to use a data-centric approach to segmenting doctors to improve marketing, customer service, and product planning."
